this is a simple language model example
language model is used to predict next words
next words in a sentence can be predicted using n-grams
n-grams are sequences of n words
in this example we use trigrams
trigrams are 3-word sequences
this is just sample data for training
you can replace this with your own text
training data helps the model learn patterns
the more diverse the training data, the better the predictions
language models have various applications
they are used in text generation, completion, and more
n-grams help capture local context
larger n-grams capture more global context
the frequency of n-grams affects their predictions
probability is used to make predictions
let's test the language model
enter a sentence to predict the next words
